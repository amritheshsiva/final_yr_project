## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login using Firebase Authentication.
- **Location Tracking:** Automatically fetches user location using OpenStreetMap API.
- **Disease Detection:** Drone captures images and detects diseases using a trained ML model.
- **Real-time Mapping:** Detected diseases are mapped with their locations in Firebase.
- **Prediction Images:** Displays images of detected diseases with details in the app.

## How It Works

1. **User Login:** User logs in using Firebase Authentication.
2. **Location Fetching:** The app fetches the user's location using OpenStreetMap API and displays it on the Map tab.
3. **Disease Detection:** The drone, equipped with a camera and ML model, captures images of coconut trees.
4. **Data Upload:** If a disease is detected, the drone stores the disease name, location, and captured image in Firebase.
5. **Prediction Display:** The app retrieves disease data and images from Firebase and displays them in the Prediction tab.
